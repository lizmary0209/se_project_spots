-Clean UI/UX: Designed with user experience in mind, including intuitive button interactions.

-Optimized Assets: Images exported from Figma and compressed for faster loading times.

-Efficient Code: JavaScript used to streamline functionality and improve performance.

*Tools & Technologies

-HTML & CSS: Structure, layout, and styling.

-JavaScript: Functionality and dynamic features.

-Node.js: Deployment and build processes.

-Figma: UI/UX design and prototyping.

-UX Design: Applied to interactive elements for a user-friendly experience.

*What I Learned

Through this project, I strengthened my ability to:

-Build fully responsive layouts that adapt to multiple screen sizes.

-Optimize project performance by reducing image sizes and streamlining code.

-Apply UX design principles to create user-friendly interactions.

-Use Git and GitHub for version control and project deployment.

-Translate Figma prototypes into clean, functional code.

*Next Steps

If I were to continue improving this project, I would:

-Add accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, improved contrast).

-Implement more advanced JavaScript functionality (e.g., form validation, animations).

-Integrate a back-end to handle dynamic content.

-Enhance performance further with lazy loading and caching strategies.

-Expand testing coverage for better reliability.
